The map_items example app shows how to pin images and 3D objects to mark specific spots on the map. You can find how this is done in [MapItemsExample.dart](lib/MapItemsExample.dart). The app also shows how to draw polylines, arrows, polygons and circles on the map. You can find how this is done in [MapObjectsExample.dart](lib/MapObjectsExample.dart).
